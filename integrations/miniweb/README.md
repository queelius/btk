Export the bookmarks -- retrieving the pages pointed to by the bookmarks, but as a
graph structure so you can move between pages based on:

1) how many (undirected) hops to get from one to the other.
2) semantic similarity (embeddings) of the page contents
3) ?
4) a hybrid of all of these.

so you can click on a page in the viewer, and it will embed the page inside a larger
website (static) that is aware of the network structure. the larger website
that embeds the page will show nearby nodes (bookmark urls), metadata about the
node, and the graph, etc.

it can also, the larger webpage, show a dynamic graph. imagine these as zoom in
and zoom out, when you zoom really far out, you see the  entire graph, when  you
zoom in, you can start to see the  content of the pages.
