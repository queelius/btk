A modern, responsive web dashboard for Bookmark Toolkit (BTK) that provides a beautiful interface for managing and visualizing your bookmarks.

## Features

### Phase 1 (Current)
- **Real-time Statistics** - View total bookmarks, tags, starred items, and duplicates
- **Bookmark Management** - Add, edit, delete, and star bookmarks
- **Search & Filter** - Search bookmarks by title, URL, tags, or description

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. BTK API server running (see `../btk-api/README.md`)
2. Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Installation
```bash
# No installation needed - just open in browser
open index.html

# Or serve with any static file server
python -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage

1. Start the BTK API server:
```bash
cd ../btk-api
python server.py
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

3. The dashboard will automatically connect to the API at `http://localhost:8000`
